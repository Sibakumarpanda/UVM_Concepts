UVM classes have 3 major types :

UVM object
UVM transaction
UVM component

uvm_void : 
The uvm_void is the base class for all the UVM classes. It is an abstract class that does not have any data members or methods implemented. It is a generic container for objects to be created similar to void pointer in C language.
Syntax: virtual class uvm_void

uvm_object: 
The UVM object is a data structure used for testbench configuration and it is the base class available for component and sequence branch. The uvm_object provides methods like create, clone, copy, record, compare, print, etc.

uvm_report_object: 
The uvm_report_object provides reporting functionality for UVM. The message, error, or warning prints are very important for debugging purposes that are being facilitated by the uvm_report_object class.
Most of the methods in uvm_report_object are passed to an instance of uvm_report_handler that stores reporting configuration. 
Based on the configurations, uvm_report_handler decides whether to display the message or not. 
It is then passed to uvm_report_server for actual formatting and producing the messages. 
The detailed report has information for id string, verbosity level, severity, and a complete message string.
Report macros: UVM provides a set of macros that are wrappers around uvm_report_* functions as shown below.

Macros                                           Reporting functions                                Syntax
`uvm_info                                        uvm_report_info                                    `uvm_info(ID,MSG,VERBOSITY)
`uvm_warning                                     uvm_report_warning                                 `uvm_warning(ID,MSG)
`uvm_error                                       uvm_report_error                                   `uvm_error(ID,MSG)
`uvm_fatal                                       uvm_report_fatal                                   `uvm_fatal(ID,MSG)

Where, 
ID: message tag
MSG: A text message
VERBOSITY: If VERBOSITY is lower than configured verbosity for that reporter, it will be printed.
Note: `uvm_warning has UVM_NONE as a default verbosity.

uvm_verbosity:
  UVM defines standard verbosity for report displays. Note : In below , priority order will be from Highest (UVM_NONE) to Lowest (UVM_DEBUG)

Verbosity       | Description    
 UVM_NONE       | Always printed, verbosity configuration cannot disable it 
 UVM_LOW        | Prints a message if verbosity is configured as UVM_LOW or above    
 UVM_MEDIUM     | Prints a message if verbosity is configured as UVM_MEDIUM or above    
 UVM_HIGH       | Prints a message if verbosity is configured as UVM_HIGH or above   
 UVM_FULL       | Prints a message if verbosity is configured as UVM_FULL or above    
 UVM_DEBUG      | Prints a message if verbosity is configured as UVM_DEBUG    

UVM Transaction:
UVM transaction is used for generating stimulus and its analysis.
They are transient in nature .The simple transactions can be derived from the uvm_transaction class. 
But sequence-specific transactions are recommended to derive from uvm_sequence_item.

UVM Components :
UVM components are used to build a class-based hierarchical structure for the testbench. 
The uvm_component are static and physical components that exist throughout the simulation. 
The uvm_component class is a base class for all UVM components.
For testbench hierarchy, base class components are available in UVM as uvm_env, uvm_agent, uvm_monitor, uvm_driver, uvm_sequencer, etc.
The uvm_component provides the following interfaces like Hierarchy ,Phasing ,Reporting,Objection , Configuration,Transaction recording ,factory etc

Hierarchy:
Provides methods for searching and traversing component hierarchy.
Example:
get_parent: It returns a handle for the current componentâ€™s parent. If it has no parent, then it returns null.
get_full_name: It returns a complete hierarchical name for this object
