# UVM_Concepts_and_Coding_by_Siba

Welcome to the UVM for Verification repository, **UVM_Concepts_and_Coding_by_Siba** !!! 

Happy Learning & Coding ðŸ˜„ 

This repository contains UVM Concepts with code examples and scripts to help you understand how to use UVM for functional verification. 

## Running the Code

To run the UVM code examples in this repository, you can use **EDA Playground**, an online simulation platform. Follow these steps to get started:

1. **Visit EDA Playground:**
   Open your browser and go to [EDA Playground](https://www.edaplayground.com).

2. **Configure Your Environment:**
   - On the left side of the page, find the **UVM** option and set it to **1.1d** or for some codes **1.2** .
   - Set **Tools & Simulators** to  any Simulation tools like Aldec/Synopsys/Cadence/Simens Questa. Here i have used mostly **Synopsys VCS 2023.03**. 

3. **Run the Simulation:**
   After the configuration, simply click on the **Run** button to start the simulation.

The code will execute on the platform, and you can view the simulation results in the output section.
