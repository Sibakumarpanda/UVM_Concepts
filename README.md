# UVM_Concepts_and_Coding_by_Siba

Welcome to the UVM (Universal Verification Methodology) for Verification tutorial repository! 
This repository contains UVM Concepts with code examples and scripts to help you understand how to use UVM for functional verification. 

## Running the Code

To run the UVM code examples in this repository, you can use **EDA Playground**, an online simulation platform. Follow these steps to get started:

1. **Visit EDA Playground:**
   Open your browser and go to [EDA Playground](https://www.edaplayground.com).

2. **Configure Your Environment:**
   - On the left side of the page, find the **UVM** option and set it to **1.1d** or for some codes **1.2** .
   - Set **Tools & Simulators** to  any Simulation tools like Aldec/Synopsys/Cadence/Simens Questa. Here i have used mostly **Synopsys VCS 2023.03**. 

3. **Run the Simulation:**
   After the configuration, simply click on the **Run** button to start the simulation.

The code will execute on the platform, and you can view the simulation results in the output section.
